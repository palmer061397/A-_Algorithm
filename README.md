# Manhattan Graph A* Algorithm

This Python script implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two locations in Manhattan represented as vertices in a graph.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `math` module
- `heapq` module

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Run the script:


## Usage

To find the shortest path between two locations in Manhattan, you need to modify the `a_star.py` file and specify the starting and target vertices. Then, run the script and observe the output.

## File Structure

- `a_star.py`: Main Python script containing the implementation of the A* algorithm.
- `manhattan_graph.py`: File containing the definition of the Manhattan graph and its vertices.
